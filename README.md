# TEST_PROJECT Content Hub

A modular content platform for displaying various types of content including interactive React components and static HTML.

## Overview

This project serves as both a working example and a template for creating content hubs with:

- A collapsible sidebar navigation
- Table of Contents for easy content discovery
- Support for both static HTML content and interactive React components
- Simple password protection for access control
- Deployment-ready for GitHub Pages or Netlify

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A local web server (Python's built-in server, Node.js http-server, etc.)
- Node.js and npm (for building React components)

### Running the Project

1. Start a local web server in the project root:
   ```
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
   or
   ```
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```

2. Access the site at: http://localhost:8000

3. Enter the password when prompted: `TEST_PROJECT`

## Content Types

This project supports two main types of content:

1. **Static HTML Content**: Simple HTML pages in the `EXPRESS/` directories
2. **Interactive React Components**: React applications built and placed in their respective component folders

## Adding New Content

### Static HTML Content

1. Create a new folder in the `EXPRESS/` directory
2. Add an `index.html` or `page.html` file with your content
3. Run `node generate-toc.js` to update the table of contents

### Interactive React Components

1. Create a new folder in the `src_react/` directory
2. Implement your React component using the career-proposal as a reference
3. Configure the build to output to the appropriate folder in `EXPRESS/`
4. Build the component using npm or yarn
5. Update `toc.html` to link to your new component

## Building React Components

To build the sample career proposal component:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/build-career-proposal.sh

# Run the build script
./scripts/build-career-proposal.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
cd src_react/career-proposal
npm install
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

To deploy to GitHub Pages:

1. Ensure you have the `.nojekyll` file in the root directory (already included)
2. Push your changes to GitHub
3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings
4. Choose the branch you want to deploy (usually `main` or `master`)

Note: The `.nojekyll` file is crucial as it tells GitHub not to process your files with Jekyll, preventing Liquid template syntax errors.

### Netlify

To deploy to Netlify:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify
2. The included `netlify.toml` file already has the correct settings:
   - Build command: `./scripts/build-all.sh`
   - Publish directory: `.` (the project root)

## Best Practices

- Keep components self-contained with minimal global dependencies
- Use relative URLs in links and asset references
- Design components to work within the iframe context
- Follow the established pattern for linking to interactive components in `toc.html`
